Discovers JFAs Frequently Asked Questions for SHL Assessments What is the SHL OPQ? The Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ) is SHL's flagship personality assessment, widely used to predict how a candidate's preferred personal style impacts their workplace behavior. It provides insights into an individual's potential by matching their preferences to role requirements and is backed by science with strong predictive accuracy. Are SHL assessments reliable? SHL's adherence to legal and scientific standards ensures that its assessments are developed and validated to be fair, reliable, and appropriate for their intended purposes in selection processes. The reliability of SHL assessments is reviewed during test development as well as a part of ongoing test maintenance practices. We document the reliability of our assessments (e.g., through test-retest and internal consistency methods) in our technical manuals. What are psychometric assessments? Psychometric assessments are standardized tests designed to assess candidates' cognitive abilities, personality traits, job-related skills and behavioral styles. They help organizations understand how candidates may perform in specific roles. SHL assessments are scientifically developed tools built on psychometric principles, ensuring they are reliable, valid, and suitable for making informed talent decisions. Why should I use psychometric assessments? Psychometric assessments offer objective and reliable insights into candidates' individual differences such as skills, abilities, personality traits, and potential, enabling organizations to make informed talent decisions. They help ensure a strong fit for specific roles and promote fairness by reducing bias. When applied consistently throughout the talent lifecycle, these assessments provide valuable data for strategic talent decisions, enhancing organizational agility and maximizing workforce effectiveness. Can psychometric assessments be tailored for an organization? Yes, many providers, including SHL, can offer fully customizable assessments that align with your organization's specific competencies, values, and culture so that you get exactly what you need out of your talent processes. Is it better to use psychometric assessments or AI to collect talent data? While AI-inferred talent data may offer some value, it is often less reliable and may introduce inaccuracies. Psychometric assessments, on the other hand, provide a more objective and scientifically validated understanding of what a candidate can do. In practice, AI-inferred data might be combined with psychometric data, but for robust and defensible decision-making, psychometric tools offer greater reliability and value. Are SHL assessments valid? SHL's adherence to legal and scientific standards ensures that its assessments are developed and validated to be fair, reliable, and appropriate for their intended purposes in selection processes. Information and evidence regarding the content, construct, and criterion-related validity of our assessments is documented in our technical manuals. However, the validity of these assessments depends on their proper use, which is beyond our control. We advise users to adhere to best practices to ensure accurate and fair outcomes. Are SHL assessments fair?
